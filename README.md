# Dicee

## Goal

The objective of this tutorial is to introduce the core programming concepts that will form the foundation of most apps. This app will teach a lot of important programming knowledge, while building a neat dice app.

## What I created

A Las Vegas dice app. You can make the die roll at the press of a button or by shaking your phone. With this app in your pocket, youâ€™ll be fully set up to settle any score on the go!


## What I learned

* How to clone an existing Xcode project from GitHub.
* Create an app with behaviour and functionality.
* Create links between the Interface Builder files and code using IBActions and IBOutlets.
* Get familiar with the Xcode code editor.
* Learn to use comments to annotate code.
* Understand and use Swift constants and variables.
* Understand and use collection types such as Swift arrays.
* Test and debug your app with the Xcode console.
* Randomisation and how to generate random numbers in Swift.
